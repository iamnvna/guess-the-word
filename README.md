### Project Fifteen - 100DaysOfCode
# Guess the Word
This is a simple program collects user input (a random word) and evaluates it against a rando generated word by the program. The user gets two attempts, and a hint.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate variable.
3. Using print statements, print out the game instructions to the user.
4. Create a variable to hold the list of words the user is to guess.
5. Use the appropriate library method to select a random word from the list of words and assign it to a variable.
6. Collect the user guess and assign it to a variable.
7. Evaluate the user guess against the random word selected by the program.
8. Print the appropriate output that correlates with the evaluation from step 7 using if/else statements.
9. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program improved my use of if/else if/else and 'if ... in ...' statement use.
* This program allowed me to explore functions once again.
* I was successful declaring a global variable that worked in the defined function. This was a challenge with my previous project. Still learning more about it.
